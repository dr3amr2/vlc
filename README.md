vlcj 
------------

This project used skeleton (https://github.com/fractal/skeleton) to develop an initial base project to work with SBT and scala. It was configured to work with the following:

     Scala 2.10.3
     SBT 0.13.1
     ScalaTest 2.0
     ScalaCheck 1.11.2
     IntelliJ IDEA 
     Scala-IDE 3.0+

------------

Additional Notes - Original source code to implement vlcj with java was derived from https://github.com/p3s3us/jPlayer.  It was a simple player that was cloned, but the implementation has been drastically changed to motto after the MVC implementation.
